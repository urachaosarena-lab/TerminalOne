     - `logger.logTransaction()` - Transaction events
     - `logger.logUserAction()` - User interactions
     - `logger.logFeeCollection()` - Fee collection events
     - `logger.logSecurity()` - Security-related events

- `src/utils/validation.js` - Input validation service
- `src/middleware/rateLimiter.js` - Rate limiting middleware
- `src/middleware/sessionSecurity.js` - Session management with CSRF
- `src/services/TransactionVerificationService.js` - On-chain transaction verification
- `src/services/BackupService.js` - Automated backup system

## üìù Modified Files

- `src/utils/logger.js` - Enhanced with structured logging and multiple log files
- `src/services/WalletService.js` - Integrated encryption for sensitive data
- `src/services/MonitoringService.js` - Added Telegram alerting
- `.env.example` - Added `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` configuration
- `package.json` - Version bump to 0.06.0
- `VERSION` - Updated to v0.06

## üîß Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# Security - Wallet Encryption
# Generate: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_char_hex_encryption_key_here

# Admin Configuration (comma-separated Telegram user IDs)
ADMIN_CHAT_IDS=your_telegram_user_id_here
```

## üöÄ Deployment

1. **Generate encryption key:**
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

2. **Add to .env:**
   ```
   WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generated_key>
   ```

3. **Deploy using standard script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. **Verify services:**
   - Check logs in `logs/` directory
   - Verify backups in `backups/` directory
   - Test `/admin` command (admin users only)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### For Existing Deployments

- **Wallet migration:** Existing wallets will be automatically encrypted on first save after upgrade
- **No data loss:** All existing data is preserved during upgrade
- **Backup first:** Although automatic backups are included, manually backup your `data/` folder before upgrading

### Security Best Practices

1. **Keep encryption key secure:** Never commit `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to version control
2. **Restrict admin access:** Only add trusted Telegram user IDs to `ADMIN_CHAT_IDS`
3. **Monitor alerts:** Admins will receive Telegram notifications for system issues
4. **Review logs regularly:** Check `logs/security.log` for unauthorized access attempts
5. **Test backups:** Periodically verify backup integrity via admin panel

## üìä Monitoring

Admins can monitor system health via:

- **Telegram alerts:** Real-time notifications for critical issues
- **Admin panel:** `/admin` command for dashboard access
- **Log files:** `logs/` directory for detailed investigation
- **Backup status:** Daily backups with 30-day retention

## üîç Testing Checklist

- [ ] Wallet encryption working (check `data/wallets.json` contains encrypted keys)
- [ ] Rate limiting enforced (test with rapid requests)
- [ ] CSRF protection active (test sensitive operations)
- [ ] Transaction verification working (test fee collection)
- [ ] Input validation preventing invalid data
- [ ] Backups created daily (check `backups/` directory)
- [ ] Logs being written to `logs/` directory
- [ ] Alerts sent to admin Telegram (test by triggering error threshold)
- [ ] Admin panel accessible with `/admin` command (admins only)
- [ ] Non-admins blocked from admin commands

## üêõ Known Issues

None at release time.

## üìà Next Steps (v0.07+)

Potential future enhancements:

- 2FA for admin panel
- Database migration for scalability
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Webhook integrations for external monitoring
- Automated security scans
- Performance optimizations
